#Some conditionals and loops we did in class feb 12

#for i in range(10, 1, -1):
 #   print(i)
# output: range makes a set of numbers for forloop to iterate about

#for i in range(1, 10, 3):
    #print(i)
    #permitted to go up by three even if its not an "even" step
mylist = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for i in range(len(mylist)):
    print(i)
